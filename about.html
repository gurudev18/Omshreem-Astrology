                <h3>Dear Patron,</h3>
                I come from an orthodox and deeply traditional family, devoted to our Family Goddess Tulja Bhavani and God Kandobha. My grandfather, the late Mr. M.C. Eshwar Rao, and my grandmother, the late Mrs. B.L. Kasturi Bai, were pillars of our religious community. My grandfather, who received Guru Bohdan from his Sadh Guru at the tender age of ten, was a beacon of wisdom and guidance. Together, my grandparents dedicated every Friday to serving others at our Bhavani temple in Mysore. Devotees would gather in large numbers, seeking solutions to their problems, and my grandparents would selflessly provide remedies, embodying the spirit of social service.<br><br>


                They also performed countless marriages for the underprivileged, irrespective of caste, and provided jobs, shelter, food, and clothing to those in need. They were role models for our entire family, and their legacy continues to guide us. My uncle, the late Mr. Srinivasa Rao M.E, who returned from the US, embraced these noble duties with the same dedication. I had the privilege of witnessing and participating in these activities alongside him. Our discussions and predictions during consultations were invaluable lessons that shaped my understanding of astrology from a young age.<br><br>
                
                Our Gurus and Sadgurus blessed and foretold that I would carry forward this tradition, making a significant impact through my predictions. Today, I am committed to following in the footsteps of my grandparents and uncle. For over 20 years, I have successfully predicted more than 5000 horoscopes, achieving a high success rate. My mission is to spread awareness and provide simple, effective solutions to those in need, making a meaningful difference in their lives. Initially, our service spread by word of mouth, but my friends insisted that I take my knowledge online to reach a broader audience. This led to the creation of our website and YouTube channel, offering guidance, remedies, and solutions through Astrology, Vaastu, and Spiritual Guidance.<br><br>
                
                What sets Vedic Astrology apart is its simplicity in understanding problems and providing solutions based on one’s horoscope. I firmly believe in the Nakshatras and their characteristics, which align with planetary positions to offer accurate remedies. The solutions I provide are unique and incomparable to most Vedic astrological websites. My journey in the world of astrology began in childhood, introduced by my grandparents and paternal uncle. Even before I knew about planets, I recognized astrology as a divine science. Reading weekly and yearly horoscopes and predicting the future became a natural part of my life.<br><br>
                
                Today, whether you are navigating educational, financial, or career challenges, seeking to improve personal relationships, aiming for deeper self-awareness, or dealing with other concerns like Vaastu, I bring a diverse skill set to provide comprehensive and personalized advice. I am deeply devoted to Adi Shakthi Tulja Bhavani and have a profound love for Vedic astrology. I am excited to share my knowledge and help others achieve their goals through a blend of logical strategy and cosmic insight.<br>
